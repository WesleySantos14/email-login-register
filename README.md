# customization
Feel free to customize anything you want, just make sure to not break anything ig? But you can always go back using local history

# pro tip
if you want to deploy your project finally as a website, i recommend uploading it to github that way you can edit it later! After you upload it check out https://www.netlify.com/ for hosting your website, its free and always runs!
